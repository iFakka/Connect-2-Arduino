# Connect-2-Arduino

Set Up the Circuit:

Drag and drop two Arduino Uno boards onto the workspace.
Connect the GND (ground) pins of both boards together.
Connect one board's 5V pin to the other board's 5V pin.
Connect the A4 pin of one board to the A4 pin of the other board.
Connect the A5 pin of one board to the A5 pin of the other board.
Place an LED on one of the boards by dragging it from the components panel.
Connect the longer leg (anode) of the LED to a current-limiting resistor (220Î©) and connect the other end of the resistor to a digital pin (pin 13) on the same board.
Connect the shorter leg (cathode) of the LED to the GND pin.
Place a pushbutton on the other board.
Connect terminal 1b of the pushbutton to the GND pin.
Connect terminal 1a of the pushbutton to the 5V pin.
Connect terminal 2b of the pushbutton to the A0 pin.
